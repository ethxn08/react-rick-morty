### Linting and formatting

This project is setup using eslint and prettier for linting and code formatting.

At Assembler School, we recommend that all our students use them since they
provide great value with too much additional effort.

Furthermore, it also includes the `husky` and `lint-staged` packages that allow
you to run scripts on the files in the Git staging area before each commit or
before pushing changes to a remote repo.

## Deployment
